//1. create a variable that stores the information using the useParams hook (check docs) https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-params

//2. create a fetch function that makes request to backend endpoint containing the variable created before

//3. check the response from the fetch. if there is a Post coming, then:

//3.1 create a state variable (react state variable e.g  
 const [singlePost, setSinglePost]=useState({})).

//state= variable that contains a value that represensts smth that appears on the screen

//3.2 use the setter function from the state variable to update the value of that variable with the post coming in the response of the fetch request.

//useState = react hook that lets me add a state variable to my component

//3.3 Render in JSX the information store in the state variable
